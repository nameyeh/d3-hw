					<p>Depression is prevalent and imposes a very high societal burden in terms of cost, morbidity,
						quality of life, and mortality. This plot shows the percentage of people surveyed in 2014 that responded "yes" 
						to the question "Ever been told that you have a form of depression?" shown against median age by state. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						We see that people with depression diagnoses are clustered in the middle of the age range,
						between about 36-41 years of age. There is no obvious positive or negative trend, but we do see some 
						interesting outliers. UT has a higher percentage of depression and a lower median age. HI has the lowest 
						percentage of depression and a median age of 38, which is not surprising considering the tropical weather/landscape. 
						Similarly, some of the coldest areas in the Northeast have higher percentages of depression, such as ME, VT, and NH.
